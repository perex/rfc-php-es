## Introduction

Currently PHP contains many SAPIs to the servers either completely unavailable or unsupported for a long time. The same can be said about several extensions which are for long deprecated or their dependency libraries are unsupported. Here's a short list:

 Dead SAPIs:
  * aolserver
  * apache
  * apache_hooks
  * caudium
  * continuity
  * isapi
  * milter  
  * phttpd
  * pi3web
  * roxen
  * thttpd
  * tux
  * webjames
  * apache2filter - not really dead, but currently broken
  * nsapi
